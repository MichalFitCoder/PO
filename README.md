# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of small C++ programs that demonstrate key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). Each program focuses on a specific aspect of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

## Features
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation of classes with private members and public getters/setters.
- **Inheritance**: Demonstrates single and multiple inheritance with base and derived classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Examples of function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions.
- **Abstraction**: Usage of abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Design Patterns**: Implementations of common patterns like Singleton, Factory, and Observer.
- 
- ## Prerequisites
- C++17 or later
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- CMake (optional, for building)

## Compilation & Execution
### Using g++
```bash
g++ src/01_encapsulation/example.cpp -o example
./example
```
